acts\_as\_abusable
==================

Tiny plugin to mark any rails model instance as an abuse or site's community guideline violation.

Installation
------------

* Traditionally

<pre>
script/plugin install git://github.com/linkingpaths/acts_as_abusable.git
</pre>

* Gemplugin: 

If you prefer the new "gemplugin" management system just insert the dependency on environment.rb:
<pre>
config.gem "linkingpaths-acts_as_abusable", :lib => "acts_as_abusable"
</pre>
... and install it:
<pre>
rake gems:install
</pre>

* Finally use the builtin generator for the needed migration:

<pre>
script/generate acts_as_abusable_migration
rake db:migrate
</pre>


Example
-------

<pre>
class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_abusable
end
</pre>

This gives you:

<pre>
# All abuse reports about this photo 
penthouse_sweetie_photo.reported_abuses

# Positive abuses
penthouse_sweetie_photo.reported_abuses.confirmed

# Still not evaluated abuse reports
penthouse_sweetie_photo.reported_abuses.pending

# Check if this photo has been positively marked as an abuse.
penthouse_sweetie_photo.is_an_abuse?
</pre>

And a new ´Abuse´ model:

<pre>
abuse.confirmed?
abuse.confirm!

# URL used as base for the abuse report
abuse.referer

# Resource that is linked to the abuse report
abuse.resource
</pre>
